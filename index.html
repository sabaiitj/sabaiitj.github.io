							<h2>Sarcasm Detection</h2>
							<p>
								For my Data Science Immersive Capstone, I analyzed over 26,000 news headlines
							        to create a classification model for detecting sarcasm. I got the best accuracy of 80% 
								with a BERT model. Classical machine learning algorithms did not perform very well on this data with accuracy scores in 62-65% range.
								Sarcasm detection is a very specialized study subject in NLP, a type of sentiment analysis where the focus is on recognizing sarcasm rather than detecting a sentiment throughout the entire spectrum.
								The first issue we have is that, unlike sentiment analysis, where sentiment categories are clearly defined , the limits of sarcasm are not so well defined. 
								The applications of this task include designing intelligent chatbots, adding emotions into voice detection systems as also finding sarcastic reviews written by angry users on e-commerce websites.

							<h2>How to make an animal shelter outcome happy?</h2>
							<p>
								With a group of 2 other data scientists from my General
								Assembly Data Science Immersive cohort, we were able to
								effectively analyze animal shelter data to gather insights on the types of animals that are associated with the outcomes, 
								and to model an animals outcome based on their underlying statistics. 
								This classification problem can assist in identifying animals that will be expected to be difficult to adopt out among others.

								<h2>How does an average American think about climate change?</h2>
								<p>
									With a group of 3 other data scientists from my General
									Assembly Data Science Immersive cohort, we were able to
									effectively analyze data downloaded from Yale Program on Climate Change Communication to make
									data-driven recommendations on modeling with the ultimate goal being to classify a survey respondent’s answer to the target question.
								        Understanding the characteristics of the nation in the context of their belief in global warming is critical.
									It is critical for developing leads on who to do more targeted research on in order to leverage their internal marketing and public service announcement capabilities. 
									It is crucial for getting to the final goal of convincing people global warming is happening and that it is time to act.

							<h2>Understanding what makes a Popular Reddit Post </h2>
							<p>
								For this project, I wanted to utilize natural language
								processing and various machine learning models to predict whether a reddit post will be popular or not. To
								test this, I used the PRAW API to pull over 10,000 posts
								from reddit.  I was able to achieve an accuracy of 79% with a bagging classifier.
								I found that it's better to post in a subreddit with high subscriber count and tag as many high value subreddits as possible.
								Politics, games, funny,mademesmile,antiwork etc are popular topics to be tagged.

						<h2>Ames Housing Data</h2>
						<p>
							Primary objective of the project is to predict sale prices of the house for the sellers and prospective buyers to optimize the house buying process. 
							For this task, I wanted to utilize linear regression along with regularization. Accuracy scores were comparable across models and hovered around 84%.
							There were outliers, some of which were removed and some not, which can impact accuracy scores.
							Any mathematical model can not really capture behavioral aspects. So, however much I tune it, there will always be an uncertain aspect.
							So, this entire exercise can only be indicative.
